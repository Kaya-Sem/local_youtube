# YouTube Channel RSS Feed Downloader

This Python script allows you to download videos from YouTube channels using their RSS feeds. By providing a list of channel URLs with their corresponding channel IDs, the script fetches the latest videos from each channel and downloads them using the yt-dlp command-line tool.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

### Setup

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine

`git clone git@github.com:Kaya-Sem/local_youtube.git`

2. Install the required packages

pip install bloat bloat and more bloat

3. pip install yt-dlp

### Usage

1. Create a text file containing a list of URLs, each representing a YouTube channel feed. Each URL should be on a separate line and should include the channel ID appended to the base URL.

```
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=
```

For example:

```
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCaiVt4r6YLPzJVgr7pOmD6w
https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCaMyDu-tZc2kfRfzvI54I0g
```

2. Run the script and provide the path to the text file as a command-line argument:

`python main.py path/to/url_file.txt`

This will fetch the latest videos from each channel in the URL file and download them using `á»³t-dlp`
